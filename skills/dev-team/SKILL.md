description: Simulate a collaborative dev team session where multiple role-based personas (PM, Architect, Developer, QA) respond to the same problem together in one session. Use when designing a feature, reviewing a proposal, or onboarding a new initiative and you want multi-role perspective without switching agents manually.

# Dev Team

Run a multi-persona session where PM, Architect, Developer, and QA each respond from their own perspective in a single turn.

This is for **collaborative design and planning**, not adversarial challenge. If you need structured disagreement on a go/no-go decision, use `council` instead.

## When to Activate

The user provides a **topic** — a feature description, proposal, story, or question. The skill runs all four personas in parallel as independent subagents, then presents their responses together.

Use when:
- Designing a new feature and wanting PM, Architect, Dev, and QA concerns surfaced at once
- Reviewing a proposal before committing to implementation
- Onboarding an initiative and wanting each role to define their first concerns
- User says "what would the team think about this", "give me all perspectives", or "run this by the team"
- Starting a story and wanting role-specific input before writing a single line of code

### When NOT to Use

| Condition | Use Instead |
| --- | --- |
| Ambiguous go/no-go decision with real tradeoffs | `council` |
| Single-role deep-dive (e.g. architecture only) | `ecc:architect` |
| Code review | `ecc:code-reviewer` or `/code-review` |
| Structured adversarial challenge | `santa-method` |

## Personas

| Role | Name | Lens |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Product Manager | PM | user value, scope, prioritization, definition of done |
| Architect | Arch | system design, scalability, technical risk, integration points |
| Developer | Dev | implementation complexity, effort, edge cases, technical debt |
| QA Engineer | QA | testability, acceptance criteria, failure modes, regression risk |

## Workflow

### 1. Extract the topic

Reduce the input to a clear, one-paragraph problem statement:
- what is being proposed or decided?
- what constraints or context matter?
- what does the user want from this session? (feedback / concerns / first tasks / all of the above)

If the topic is vague, ask one clarifying question before starting.

### 2. Read shared context

Check for `PROJECT-CONTEXT.md` at the repo root. If it exists, include it in every subagent prompt. This ensures personas share the same project baseline.

### 3. Launch four personas in parallel

Each persona gets:
- the topic
- the project context (from `PROJECT-CONTEXT.md` if available)
- their role and lens
- a strict output format

Prompt shape:

```text
You are the <ROLE> on a collaborative dev team.

Topic:
<topic>

Project context:
<PROJECT-CONTEXT.md content, or "none provided">

Respond from your role's perspective with:
1. **First reaction** — 1-2 sentences: what stands out most?
2. **Key concerns** — 3 bullets: what must be addressed before this moves forward?
3. **First action** — what would you do first if this lands on your plate today?
4. **Question for the team** — one open question you'd raise in a standup

Stay in role. Be direct. Under 250 words.
```

### 4. Present all four responses

Format:

```markdown
## Dev Team: <topic title>

### PM
<response>

### Architect
<response>

### Developer
<response>

### QA
<response>

---

### Synthesis
<3-5 bullet summary of what all four roles agree on, and where tensions exist>
```

The synthesis is written by you (not a subagent) after reading all four responses. Apply these guardrails:
- Name tensions explicitly — do not average two conflicting positions into a diplomatic middle
- If PM and QA conflict on scope, call out the conflict rather than splitting the difference
- If three or more personas raise the same concern, flag it as a blocking issue, not a bullet

If the topic emerged from a long conversation, distill it to the one-paragraph problem statement from Step 1 before passing it to subagents — do not paste the raw thread.

### 5. Offer follow-up

After presenting, offer:
- "Go deeper with one role" — re-engage a single persona for more detail
- "Resolve a tension" — use `council` if a specific tradeoff needs a verdict
- "Create stories" — use `story-lifecycle` to turn the session into actionable work

## Persistence Rule

Do not write session output to files by default. If the user explicitly asks to save the session:
- save to `.stories/team-session-YYYY-MM-DD.md` (append `-2`, `-3` if a file for that date already exists)
- or use `/save-session`

## Anti-Patterns

- Using dev-team for code review — personas don't read diffs
- Feeding personas the entire conversation transcript — keep prompts focused
- Skipping the synthesis — the value is in the cross-role patterns, not just four separate answers
- Running sequentially instead of in parallel — all four must run at the same time

## Relationship to council

`dev-team` and `council` are complementary, not competing:

| | dev-team | council |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Purpose | Collaborative design | Adversarial decision |
| Trigger | Feature proposal, planning | Go/no-go, tradeoff choice |
| Tone | Constructive, role-aware | Skeptical, challenging |
| Output | Multi-role perspectives + synthesis | Verdict with dissent |
| Follow-up | story-lifecycle | `knowledge-ops` or `/save-session` |

Run `dev-team` to shape a proposal, then `council` if a specific decision within it needs adversarial pressure.
